# Othello-Game
## About
This is my first game writing in Python. There are two game modes: human vs. human, human vs. computer. I designed the computer opponent by Greedy algorithm. Hope you have fun with it!

## How To Run
Open an IDE and choose which mode you would like to play and run the driver.
